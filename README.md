# Trajan's Tanks (Fabric) 1.17

Careful, this mod is an alpha. Right now there is no shooting in the release version, but there will soon be.

## Setup

### Vanilla Launcher:

Install fabric from [The fabricmc website](https://fabricmc.net/use) and install it.
Download the Required Dependencies (````GeckoLib```` and ````Fabric API````), and add the mod jar and dependencies to the mods folder.


*nix (MacOS/Linux): ````$USER/.minecraft````

Windows: ````%appdata%\.minecraft\````

If there is no ````mods```` folder, simply create one.

After that, restart the launcher and make sure it says fabric, then click ````Play````!

### MultiMC:

Create a new instance. After that, click ````Edit instance```` on the right side, and click ````Install fabric````.

Next, click ````ok````, and click on ````Loader mods```` tab on the window.

Download the Required Dependencies (````GeckoLib```` and ````Fabric API````), and then drag the three mods into the 
````Loader mods```` tab.

Click ````Play````, and you're done!
